 # A potential way to automate the Rocket Fuel process using Google drive APIs and Python

This script scans the folder of Virtual Missions Google Forms responses 
and automatically adds rocket fuel to the master sheet.

the script could be on a cron job, and automatically run once a day at night when the kids are asleep.

__This should make the Google Shees much faster, as there aren't tons of formulas within each cell.__
